This will be my fist web application!
It takes a dataset, vehicles_us.csv, and compares price by model year(to see how vehicles depreciate)
It then compares odometer by price to (to see how miles affect depreciation)
The code is refactored from triple ten's blog post. It uses packages: pandas, plotly.express, and streamlit. The methods used are: st.header,
st.dataframe, st.write, px.scatter, and px.histogram.

It is still a work in progress as I do not know how to fix the last data visulization(the one that the user can change the parameter of)

The code to write a similar application is on tripleten's blog post, here:https://www.tripleten.blog/posts/deploying-data-science-web-apps-to-the-cloud, as well as on Github here:https://github.com/alex000kim/simple-streamlit-datavis-app/blob/main/app.py
